      <h1>Why This Should Have Failed Immediately</h1>
    
      <h2>The Expectation: Errors Would Accumulate</h2>
      <p>Everyone assumed that fake entries would drift. Human mistakes usually do. Wrong totals. Missing stock. A bartender forgetting to ring something in. The belief was that repetition would expose the lie. Instead, each entry corrected the next one. Because the same sale shape was reused, the system learned what “normal” looked like and enforced it.</p>
    
      <h2>The Expectation: Someone Would Notice the Timing</h2>
      <p>After-hours activity is supposed to stand out. In this case, it did not. The transactions landed in a dead zone between camera coverage and shift logs. No alarms triggered because nothing exceeded limits. The action that broke expectation was restraint. The amounts stayed small. The timing never moved. That is why no one stopped it.</p>
    
      <h2>The Expectation: Removing a Person Would Stop It</h2>
      <p>When attention finally arrived, it focused on individuals. Question staff. Detain a manager. Remove the architect. But the records were already teaching themselves. By the time a human tried to intervene, the system no longer depended on intent. It depended on history. That is why events continued even after intervention began.</p>
