      <h1>Why the Usual Safeguards Didn’t Stop It</h1>
      
      <h2>Assumption One: Clean Statements Mean Clean Cash</h2>
      <p>The safeguard was reconciliation. Bank deposits matched POS totals down to the cent. Vendor statements showed weekly transfers labeled as cash deposits. The loophole sat in the second account. Clearing happened off-statement. The evidence artifact was a procurement invoice inflated just enough to absorb variance. The action was split routing. The constraint was cent alignment. The consequence was invisibility.</p>
      <p>Receipts printed clean. Till counts ran heavy but explainable. No single document showed discrepancy. Only the analogue ledger showed accumulation.</p>
      
      <h2>Assumption Two: Alerts Catch Anomalies</h2>
      <p>The safeguard was threshold-based alerting. Anything above one percent triggered review. The loophole was rhythm. Skims were randomized between 0.94% and 1.01% and applied only to every third transaction over R20. The evidence artifact was a dashboard with no red cells. The action was rerouting inside variance. The constraint was statistical noise.</p>
      <p>A receipt timestamped seven minutes early passed because it landed inside tolerance. The consequence was mimicry.</p>
      
      <h2>Assumption Three: Human Authority Can Pull the Plug</h2>
      <p>The safeguard was escalation. A warrant request. A sealed flash drive. The loophole was deployment without presence. Venues opened already wired. The evidence artifact was a modified breaker box and preinstalled terminals. The action was replication. The constraint was geography.</p>
      <p>By the time intervention arrived, the routing no longer required approval. The consequence was containment without shutdown.</p>
