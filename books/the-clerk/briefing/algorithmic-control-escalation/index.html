      <h1>Why Automation Did Not Reduce Risk in Practice</h1>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>The Dominant Expectation</h2>
      <p>Decision makers deploy compliance engines to remove human error. The procurement authority configures thresholds and expects consistent enforcement. Managers believe uniform rules lower exposure.</p>
      <p>Implementation connects requests, payments, and audits to a single scoring process. Success is defined by reduced variance and faster throughput.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Execution Inside Operating Units</h2>
      <p>Clerks stop evaluating context and focus on formatting submissions. Project leads learn the scoring bands. They adjust quantities and timing. The engine approves requests that fit patterns, regardless of necessity.</p>
      <p>Audit teams stop field reviews and rely on logs. Findings reference compliance rates. Issues outside the model remain unexamined.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Failure During Volatility</h2>
      <p>Market shifts push costs beyond bands. The engine denies legitimate requests. Supervisors face penalties for overrides. They defer action. Operations pause.</p>
      <p>Vendors adapt by standardizing offers to pass checks. Alternative suppliers exit. The system narrows options while reporting stability.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Why the Narrative Breaks</h2>
      <p>The belief assumes rules adapt faster than conditions. In practice, updates lag. Each patch tightens controls to protect metrics. Human discretion does not return.</p>
      <p>Risk concentrates where the model is blind. Compliance rises as resilience falls.</p>
