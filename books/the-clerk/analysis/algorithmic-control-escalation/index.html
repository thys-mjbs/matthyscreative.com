      <h1>How the Cash Routing Actually Worked</h1>
      
      <h2>Phase One: Quiet Installation</h2>
      <p>The first movement did not involve theft. It involved placement. A POS terminal was installed at a wine bar in Salt River without a merchant ID, without onboarding paperwork, and without a vendor log confirming compatibility. The hardware matched an existing format exactly: dual-mounted terminals, relay switch under the base plate, node bridge wired behind the counter. A PDF invoice arrived afterward, not before, listing event spend with margins inside tolerance. The artifact was clean. The action was silent. The risk was exposure through absence. No record meant no audit trail, and no audit trail meant the system accepted it as memory.</p>
      <p>A hardbound black ledger sat open while the PDF was reviewed. The ledger tracked two things at once: where cash entered and where it reappeared under new names. The POS receipt roll showed totals aligned to the cent. The constraint was skimming tolerance. Anything above one percent would surface. Anything below disappeared. The consequence was replication. Once the placement held, the same wiring appeared again at Greenmarket, then Stellenbosch.</p>
      
      <h2>Phase Two: Dual-Account Drift</h2>
      <p>Two accounts shared the same company name. Account 1 produced statements. Account 2 cleared volume. Vendor cash and injected cash landed together, deposited in round numbers with no cents and no receipt IDs. Transfers to Account 1 were labeled “Cash Deposit” only. No reference string. No vendor ever saw both sides. The tangible proof was a bank statement with weekly inflows that matched remembered handoffs. The action was drip-feeding. The constraint was timing. Transfers occurred inside a forty-eight-hour window to match staff recollection.</p>
      <p>The skim never appeared as a line item. It hid inside procurement invoices printed on cheap paper with inflated totals. A 0.99% margin shaved from every third transaction over R20 moved into a holding envelope. The physical till ran heavy. The bank balance stayed clean. The consequence was scale. Once three venues held, the routing expanded to Strand and Bellville without ceremony.</p>
      
      <h2>Phase Three: Mimicry Detection</h2>
      <p>The first warning was not an alert. It was a receipt printed seven minutes early. The timestamp was ahead, not behind. The printer log matched future memory. A terminal ID appeared after 03:00 with user set to “Admin” and a customer name manually entered: T. Godi. The name existed once before in a buried hotel comp report tied to an inactive terminal. The artifact was residue. The action was recursive writing. The constraint was plausibility. The alias appeared only after hours.</p>
      <p>An analogue ledger was reopened. Entries passed audit but not instinct. Vendor logs showed jitter delay replicated perfectly. The system did not flag it. The consequence was severance. One integration was cut without notice. Silence followed. No confirmation message. No reversal.</p>
      
      <h2>Phase Four: Lock-In</h2>
      <p>A venue in a different country opened already wired. POS terminals installed. Breaker box modified. A briefcase sat unlocked in the back office holding vacuum-sealed USD bricks and a card marked with a phase number and a test load. The instruction was clear: run Wednesday, no latency, no bleed. The tangible artifact was the wiring channel under the floor grate, curved exactly as originally designed. The action was inheritance. The constraint was volume. Forty million required the same tolerance as forty rand.</p>
      <p>A human attempt to intervene arrived late. A flash drive slid across a desk containing names, methods, and patterns. A warrant was promised. The system did not pause. The consequence was stabilization without consent. The routing continued, indifferent to observation.</p>
