      <h1>How Algorithmic Control Quietly Replaces Human Authority</h1>
      <p>Large-scale systems rarely seize power directly. They absorb it by standardizing decisions, reallocating responsibility, and making deviation operationally expensive. This page breaks down how algorithmic control actually functions inside modern institutions, where accountability moves, and why reversal becomes impractical once embedded.</p>
    
      <h2>How Decision Authority Is Gradually Externalized</h2>
      <p>The first step is not automation. It is translation. Human judgment is converted into rules, thresholds, and scoring criteria so it can be processed at speed. Managers approve this because it removes variability and shortens decision cycles.</p>
      <p>Once translated, authority shifts. Operators no longer decide outcomes; they manage inputs. The system produces a result, and the human role becomes verification rather than judgment. Overrides exist, but every override generates friction, logging, and review.</p>
      <p>Over time, override frequency becomes a performance signal. Staff who intervene often are flagged as inconsistent. Staff who follow outputs are rewarded for compliance. Authority migrates not because the system is right, but because it is easier to defend.</p>
    
      <h2>Why Systems Become the Default Arbiter</h2>
      <p>Systems persist because they provide plausible deniability. When an outcome is challenged, responsibility points to process adherence rather than individual choice. This protects organizations legally and reputationally.</p>
      <p>As reliance grows, institutional memory decays. New staff are trained on interfaces, not rationale. Historical context is removed because it cannot be queried or scored. The system becomes the only reference point that matters.</p>
      <p>At this stage, removing the system would require rebuilding judgment capacity that no longer exists. Dependence is not technical; it is organizational.</p>
    
      <h2>Incentives That Lock the System in Place</h2>
      <p>Incentives align around throughput and risk reduction. Faster processing, fewer disputes, and auditable logs become metrics of success. Accuracy is assumed because the system is consistent.</p>
      <p>Vendors reinforce lock-in by tying updates, compliance features, and integrations to continued use. Internal teams build workflows around the outputs, not the logic. Switching costs rise silently.</p>
      <p>Once downstream systems depend on upstream scores, the algorithm becomes infrastructural. Questioning it threatens multiple departments simultaneously.</p>
    
      <h2>Failure Modes That Remain Invisible Until Scale</h2>
      <p>Small errors compound when decisions are chained. A misweighted variable propagates across thousands of cases. Because no single decision appears catastrophic, the pattern remains unnoticed.</p>
      <p>Appeal mechanisms exist but are rate-limited. They are designed to handle exceptions, not systemic drift. When appeals increase, the response is to tighten criteria, not revisit assumptions.</p>
      <p>The system does not fail loudly. It fails by normalizing suboptimal outcomes and redefining them as acceptable.</p>
    
      <h2>Where Control Actually Resides</h2>
      <p>Control is not held by developers or executives once deployment stabilizes. It resides in maintenance priorities, update cycles, and data pipelines. Whoever controls inputs controls outcomes.</p>
      <p>Governance bodies focus on policy statements, not parameter tuning. By the time issues surface at the policy level, operational momentum makes reversal impractical.</p>
