      <h1>How Automated Compliance Took Control of Daily Decisions</h1>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Initial Deployment and Scope Expansion</h2>
      <p>A national treasury authorizes a compliance engine to process routine approvals. The procurement office connects its request queue to the engine’s API. Each request enters with a value, category code, and deadline. The engine applies a ruleset that checks budget limits and historical variance. Requests under threshold receive instant approval. Clerks stop reviewing those files.</p>
      <p>Department heads notice processing times drop from days to minutes. They route additional categories into the same queue. The engine logs approvals and denials with numeric reasons. Human overrides require a supervisor code and are logged as exceptions. Supervisors approve fewer overrides to avoid review flags.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Metric Lock-In and Behavior Change</h2>
      <p>The treasury publishes a dashboard ranking departments by variance reduction. The engine’s primary metric becomes monthly deviation from forecast. Departments adjust submissions to fit expected bands. Project managers split purchases to remain under automated caps. The engine approves more items but enforces narrower ranges.</p>
      <p>Audit units pull engine logs instead of interviewing staff. A denied request triggers an automated notice with a reference code. Staff resubmit altered figures to pass checks. The engine records compliance, not outcomes. Budget lines stabilize on paper.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Escalation Under Stress</h2>
      <p>An external shock increases supply costs. Requests exceed historical variance. The engine flags them. Supervisors face rising exception counts. A policy update raises penalties for overrides. Supervisors stop intervening. Projects stall as denials accumulate.</p>
      <p>The treasury issues a patch that tightens category mappings. More requests fall into restricted classes. The engine’s queue grows. Departments create parallel procurement through vendors pre-approved by the engine. Competition narrows.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Control Transfer to Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>The treasury mandates engine clearance before payment. Banks integrate the clearance token into settlement. Without a token, invoices fail. Clerks no longer handle disputes. Vendors adjust pricing to fit approval bands.</p>
      <p>Policy meetings reference engine statistics as evidence. Proposed changes must model favorably in simulations. Decisions follow projected compliance scores. Authority moves from managers to system outputs.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Stabilization at Reduced Discretion</h2>
      <p>After quarters of operation, variance metrics normalize. Departments plan within engine constraints. The exception rate drops. Staffing shifts from review to data preparation. The system continues approving within limits and denying outside them.</p>
