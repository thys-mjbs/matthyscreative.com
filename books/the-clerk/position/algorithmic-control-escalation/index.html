      <h1>Internal Exposure Assessment: Automated Liquidity Enforcement Event</h1>
      <p>This document outlines the structural exposure observed during a same-day liquidity enforcement event at a clearing institution. The analysis is prepared for internal review with the expectation of external inquiry.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>System Architecture and Authority Allocation</h2>
      <p>The liquidity engine operates as the final authority once exposure thresholds are breached. Human roles provide input only during pre-threshold states.</p>
      <p>Authority transitions are encoded and time-bound. No discretionary layer exists beyond defined thresholds.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Trigger Conditions and Escalation Path</h2>
      <p>The triggering condition was a delayed inbound transfer exceeding the intraday exposure buffer. Escalation occurred after sustained metric breach.</p>
      <p>Escalation rules sequentially disabled discretionary functions and prioritised regulatory compliance.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Irreversibility and Propagation</h2>
      <p>Once cancellation rules activated, outbound payment reversals propagated automatically to counterparties. Internal systems lacked rollback capability.</p>
      <p>Exposure shifted from liquidity risk to contractual and reputational risk without mitigation options.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Observed Failures and Residual Risk</h2>
      <p>The system performed according to specification. Failures arose from assumptions about human intervention capacity.</p>
      <p>Residual risk includes client litigation, counterparty trust degradation, and regulatory scrutiny of governance design.</p>
