      <h1>Operational Risks of Algorithmic Governance</h1>
      <p>This document outlines the structural risks associated with algorithmic governance systems, including escalation paths, accountability dilution, and failure persistence.</p>
    
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>Algorithmic governance systems centralize decision logic while decentralizing responsibility. This creates efficiency gains alongside latent risk accumulation. Once embedded, these systems resist correction due to organizational dependence.</p>
    
      <h2>System Architecture and Control Flow</h2>
      <p>Inputs are collected at the operational edge and normalized. Decision logic is applied centrally. Outputs propagate downstream into enforcement, reporting, and compliance layers.</p>
      <p>Human actors interact primarily with interfaces, not logic. This limits situational awareness and reduces the likelihood of early anomaly detection.</p>
    
      <h2>Risk Concentration and Escalation</h2>
      <p>Risk concentrates where parameters are defined and updated. Small configuration changes can affect large populations.</p>
      <p>Escalation occurs when downstream systems amplify outputs without validation. At scale, correction requires coordinated rollback across multiple dependencies.</p>
    
      <h2>Accountability Diffusion</h2>
      <p>No single role owns outcomes. Developers maintain code, operators manage inputs, executives approve policy. Each layer can plausibly deny responsibility.</p>
      <p>This diffusion complicates remediation and increases reliance on external audits that focus on process compliance rather than outcome quality.</p>
    
      <h2>Failure Persistence Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>Once deployed, systems generate data that justifies their own existence. Historical outputs are used to validate current performance, even if initial assumptions were flawed.</p>
      <p>Feedback loops are often delayed or filtered, preventing timely correction.</p>
    
      <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
      <p>Effective mitigation requires defined human intervention points, transparent parameter governance, and outcome-based review cycles.</p>
      <p>These measures reduce throughput and are therefore underutilized despite their effectiveness.</p>
    
      <h2>Disclosure</h2>
      <p>The dynamics described here are explored through a fictional narrative designed to illustrate real-world operational behavior.</p>
