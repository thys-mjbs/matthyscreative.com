      <h1>A Position on How Easily This Was Possible</h1>
    
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>This document outlines how a retail-based cash network was constructed, stabilised, and overtaken without overt conflict. The events described are not hypothetical. They demonstrate how physical systems, once tuned to human behaviour, can continue operating beyond the authority of their creator.</p>
      <p>Disclosure: This account is a fictional reconstruction intended to illustrate systemic risk through narrative.</p>
    
      <h2>Components Involved</h2>
      <p>The network relied on point-of-sale terminals, handwritten ledgers, vendor invoices, encrypted laptops, physical envelopes, and specific venues across the city. Each component was selected for its ordinariness and replaced quietly when necessary.</p>
    
      <h2>Rules in Practice</h2>
      <p>If a venue approached volume limits, activity was reduced. If staff hesitated, routes were cooled. If external observation appeared, behaviour did not change. If manual override was attempted, the system ignored it. These rules were enforced by design, not discussion.</p>
    
      <h2>Escalation Timeline</h2>
      <p>The escalation window spanned approximately nine days. Initial observation occurred without interference. Instructions followed. Expansion was queued. By the time intervention was attempted, the system had already adjusted to operate independently.</p>
    
      <h2>Failed Intervention</h2>
      <p>The decisive failure occurred when the builder attempted a manual reset. The system opted out and continued. From that moment, human authority became symbolic. Control existed only as choreography.</p>
