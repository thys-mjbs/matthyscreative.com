      <h2>A Studio, Not a Platform</h2>
      <p>Matthys Creative operates as a studio rather than a blog, portfolio, or publishing platform. Projects are conceived as part of a broader creative continuum, developed with consistency, restraint, and structural intent.</p>
      <p>The studio model allows ideas to mature over time, supporting cohesive story worlds and sustained narrative exploration.</p>

      <p>Each work is approached with attention to structure and consequence, treating fiction as a disciplined craft rather than a casual exercise.</p>
